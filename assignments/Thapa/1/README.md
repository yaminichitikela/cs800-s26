In this assignment, I got familiar about the basics of HTML, Git and Github. Here, I used a package available on npm known as learnyouhtml that taught me about the core principles and concepts of HTML via a series of simple guided examples.

The directory structure is as follows:<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;assignments -> LastName (Thapa) -> Assignment Number (1) -> html -> Assignment Exercises

The assignment exercise files are named in accordance with the concept that was learned and implemented. For example, <i>index.html</i> is the first exercise which is a boilerplate that should be included for any html files. Besides that, other files such as <i>attributes, tags, lists, references and so on</i> implement these html topics.

A screenshot showing the completion of exercises in <i>learnyouhtml</i> is shown below:
