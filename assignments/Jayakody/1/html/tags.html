         <p>Electron microscopy can achieve resolutions down to <strong>0.1 nanometers</strong>, allowing scientists to visualize individual atoms.</p>
         <p>Fluorescence microscopy uses <em>fluorophores</em> to label specific cellular components, creating stunning multicolor images of living cells.</p>
         <p>The resolution limit of light microscopy is approximately 200 nm, which follows Abbe's diffraction limit formula: d = λ/(2NA), where NA<sup>2</sup> represents the numerical aperture squared.</p>
         <p>Confocal microscopy eliminates out-of-focus light, producing sharp images with improved contrast, especially useful for thick samples like H<sub>2</sub>O-based biological tissues.</p>
         <p>Super-resolution microscopy techniques like STORM and PALM can break the diffraction limit, achieving resolutions of <span>20-50 nanometers</span> and revealing fine cellular structures.</p>
