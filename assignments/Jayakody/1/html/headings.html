         <h1>Microscopy Techniques</h1>
         
         <h2>Summary</h2>
         
         <p>Microscopy is a fundamental tool in scientific research that enables the visualization of structures too small to be seen with the naked eye. Modern microscopy techniques range from traditional light microscopy to advanced electron and super-resolution methods, each offering unique capabilities for studying biological and material samples at different scales and resolutions.</p>
         
         <h2>Examples</h2>
         
         <h3>Example 1</h3>
         
         <p>Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) uses a beam of electrons to pass through ultra-thin samples, creating high-resolution images with magnifications up to 1,000,000x. This technique is essential for studying cellular organelles, protein structures, and nanomaterials at the atomic level.</p>
         
         <h3>Example 2</h3>
         
         <p>Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) employs a focused laser beam and pinhole aperture to eliminate out-of-focus light, producing sharp optical sections through thick specimens. This technique is widely used in live-cell imaging, neuroscience, and developmental biology to create three-dimensional reconstructions of biological structures.</p>

         <p>For more information about advanced microscopy techniques, explore super-resolution methods like STORM, PALM, and STED microscopy, which break the diffraction limit of light microscopy. Additionally, scanning probe microscopy techniques such as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide complementary information about surface topography and mechanical properties at the nanoscale.</p>
